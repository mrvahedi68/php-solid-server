_Standalone Solid Server written in PHP by PDS Interop_

## Table of Contents

<!-- toc -->
<!-- tocstop -->

## Background

The Solid specifications defines what makes a "Solid Server". Parts of
those specifications are still likely to change, but at the time of this writing,
they define:

- Authentication
- Authorization (and access control)
- Content representation
- Identity
- Profiles
- Resource (reading and writing) API
- Social Web App Protocols (Notifications, Friends Lists, Followers and Following)

-->

### Installation

To install the project, clone it from GitHub and install the PHP dependencies
using Composer:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/pdsinterop/php-solid-server.git \
    && cd php-solid-server \
    && composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist
```
At this point, the application is ready to run.

## Usage

The PHP Solid server can be run in several different ways.

<!-- @TODO: Add local Dockerfile  -->

The application can be run with a Docker image of your choice or on a local
environment, using Apache, NginX, or PHP's internal HTTP server. The latter is
only advised in development.

For security reasons, the server expects to run on HTTPS (also known as HTTP+TLS).

To run insecure, set the environment variable `ENVIRONMENT` to `develop`. This
will prohibit the application from running in production mode.

<!--
   @TODO: Add single-button deploy scripts/config for Heroku, Glitch, and other
          popular playgrounds/developer oriented service providers.
-->

### Docker images

When running with your own Docker image, make sure to mount the project folder
to wherever the image expects it to be, e.g. `/app` or `/var/www`.

For instance:

```
export PORT=8080 &&        \
docker run                 \
   --env "PORT=${PORT}"    \
   --expose "${PORT}"      \
   --network host          \
   --rm                    \
   --volume "$PWD:/app"    \
   -it                     \
   php:7.3                 \
   php --docroot /app/web/ --server "localhost:${PORT}" /app/web/index.php
```
Or on Mac:
```
export PORT=8080 &&        \
docker run                 \
   --env "PORT=${PORT}"    \
   --expose "${PORT}"      \
   -p "${PORT}:${PORT}"    \
   --rm                    \
   --volume "$PWD:/app"    \
   -it                     \
   php:7.3                 \
   php --docroot /app/web/ --server "localhost:${PORT}" /app/web/index.php
```


### Local environment

How to run this application in an Apache, NginX, or other popular HTTP servers
falls outside the scope of this project.

For development purposes, the internal PHP HTTP server _is_ explained below.

#### Built-in PHP HTTP server

For development purposes a Composer `serve-dev` command has been provided. This will
run the application using PHP internal HTTP server.

To use it, run `composer serve-dev` in the project root.

**!!! FOR SECURITY REASONS, DO NOT USE THIS METHOD IN PRODUCTION !!!**

By default, the application is hosted on `localhost` port `8080`.
So if you visit http://localhost:8080/ with your browser, you should see "Hello, World!".

Both the `HOST` and `PORT` can be configured before running the command by
setting them in the environment, for instance:

```sh
HOST='solid.local' PORT=1234 composer serve-dev
```

This command can also be run through a docker container, for instance:

```
export PORT=8080 &&     \
docker run              \
   --env "PORT=${PORT}" \
   --expose "${PORT}"   \
   --network host       \
   --rm                 \
   --volume "$PWD:/app" \
   -it                  \
   composer:latest      \
   serve
```

<!-- @TODO: Set up email addresses for security and community outreach

## Security

If you discover any security related issues, please email <security@pdsinterop.org> instead of using the issue tracker.

-->

## Running solid/webid-provider-tests
Due to https://github.com/pdsinterop/php-solid-server/issues/8 you should run, in one terminal window:
```sh
HOST=127.0.0.1 composer serve-dev
```
and in another you run the [webid-provider-test](https://github.com/solid/webid-provider-tests) as:
```sh
SERVER_ROOT=http://localhost:8080 ./node_modules/.bin/jest test/surface/fetch-openid-config.test.ts
```
The current `dev` branch of php-solid-server should pass roughly 7 out of 17 tests.

1. User
   - [ ] Authentication

### Coding conventions

You can also run [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) with the configuration file that can be found in the project root directory.

This project comes with a configuration file and an executable for [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) (`.php_cs`) that you can use to (re)format your sourcecode for compliance with this project's coding guidelines:

```sh
$ composer php-cs-fixer fix
```

### Testing

The PHPUnit version to be used is the one installed as a `dev-` dependency via composer. It can be run using `composer test` or by calling it directly:

```sh
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
